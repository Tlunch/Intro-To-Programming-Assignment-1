# Intro-To-Programming-Assignment-1
A University Assignment

This repository is a python project from my university introduction to programming class. This was my first exposure to python and I liked the language and engaged with it well. The report file was an expanation I had to submit with the assignment that lays out how my code worked/ fitted the spesifications.
